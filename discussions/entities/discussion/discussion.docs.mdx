A component for a Discussion entity, supports serialization and de-serialization of Discussion objects and can be used from
both backend and frontend.

## Get started

Install and use the component in your code:

```ts
import { Discussion } from '@acme/acme.discussions.discussion';

const discussion = Discussion.from({
  title: 'Hello everyone!',
  username: 'samdoe'
});
```

## Mock data

You can use announcement mock data for development and testing purposes using the `mockDiscussions` API.

```ts
import { mockDiscussions } from '@acme/acme.discussions.discussion';
import from '@acme/corporate.entities.announcement';

const discussions = mockDiscussions();
console.log(discussions);
```
